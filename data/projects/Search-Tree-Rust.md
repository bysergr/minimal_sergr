## Description 

I made a binary search tree in the Rust programming language from scratch. 


Repository: https://github.com/bysergr/tree_rs

### Concepts Used

Some technical concepts of Rust i used for make this project are:

- Lifetimes
- Generics
- Pointers
- Traits
- POO

Thanks to the completion of this project, I will improve my understanding and management of these concepts, expanding my skills to solve different challenges with these tools in Rust.
